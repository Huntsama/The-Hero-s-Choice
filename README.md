## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Something went wrong" error**: Usually indicates an input issue. Make sure to enter valid numbers (1 or 2) at the main menu.

2. **Save/Load not working**: Ensure the `src` directory exists and has write permissions.

3. **Compilation errors**: Make sure you have Java JDK installed and are in the correct directory.

4. **Game freezes**: If the game becomes unresponsive, use Ctrl+C to exit.

## 🎯 Tips for Players

1. **Explore systematically**: The cave is only 4x4, so you can explore every location
2. **Collect all items**: Each item has a specific use that can help in your adventure
3. **Talk to allies**: The miner provides valuable guidance
4. **Use the map**: It helps you navigate and track your progress
5. **Save regularly**: Use the quit and save feature to preserve your progress
